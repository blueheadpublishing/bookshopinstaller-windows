The goal of the RailsInstaller project is to provide developers working on Windows
systems with an easy way to quickly get started using Ruby on Rails by providing
a Windows installer containing a fully functioning baseline MRI (Matz' Ruby
Implementation) Ruby environment tuned for Windows systems with libraries for
doing Ruby on Rails development.
